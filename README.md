# High-Performance-Trading
Researching high-performance and multithreaded technologies in C++ using libraries such as OpenMP, C++ AMP, and MPI

## Topic 1: SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)
- Motivation: Processing several pieces of data at once to optimize at the CPU-level
- SIMD allows vectorized operations using large registers
- Code follows 3 examples of SIMD using inline assembly, intrinsics (C++ wrappers), and compiler vectorizations
